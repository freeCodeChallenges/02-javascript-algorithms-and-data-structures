Searching is useful. However, you can make searching even more powerful when it also changes (or replaces) the text you match.

You can search and replace text in a string using `.replace()` on a string. The inputs for `.replace()` is first the regex pattern you want to search for. The second parameter is the string to replace the match or a function to do something.

```js
let wrongText = "The sky is silver.";
let silverRegex = /silver/;
wrongText.replace(silverRegex, "blue");
```

The `replace` call would return the string `The sky is blue.`.

You can also access capture groups in the replacement string with dollar signs (`$`).

```js
"Code Camp".replace(/(\w+)\s(\w+)/, '$2 $1');
```

The `replace` call would return the string `Camp Code`.

##  instructions 

Write a regex `fixRegex` using three capture groups that will search for each word in the string `one two three`. Then update the `replaceText` variable to replace `one two three` with the string `three two one` and assign the result to the `result` variable. Make sure you are utilizing capture groups in the replacement string using the dollar sign (`$`) syntax.
