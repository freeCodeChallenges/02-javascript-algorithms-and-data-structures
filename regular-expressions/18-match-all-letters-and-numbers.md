Using character classes, you were able to search for all letters of the alphabet with `[a-z]`. This kind of character class is common enough that there is a shortcut for it, although it includes a few extra characters as well.

The closest character class in JavaScript to match the alphabet is `\w`. This shortcut is equal to `[A-Za-z0-9_]`. This character class matches upper and lowercase letters plus numbers. Note, this character class also includes the underscore character (`_`).

```js
let longHand = /[A-Za-z0-9_]+/;
let shortHand = /\w+/;
let numbers = "42";
let varNames = "important_var";
longHand.test(numbers);
shortHand.test(numbers);
longHand.test(varNames);
shortHand.test(varNames);
```

All four of these `test` calls would return `true`.

These shortcut character classes are also known as <dfn>shorthand character classes</dfn>.

##  instructions 

Use the shorthand character class `\w` to count the number of alphanumeric characters in various quotes and strings.
