## Description
------

[Home - Regular Expressions](../regular-expressions/README.md)

[Before](./29-positive-and-negative-lookahead.md)  | [Next](./31-reuse-patterns-using-capture-groups.md) 

Sometimes we want to check for groups of characters using a Regular Expression and to achieve that we use parentheses `()`.

If you want to find either `Penguin` or `Pumpkin` in a string, you can use the following Regular Expression: `/P(engu|umpk)in/g`

Then check whether the desired string groups are in the test string by using the `test()` method.

```js
let testStr = "Pumpkin";
let testRegex = /P(engu|umpk)in/;
testRegex.test(testStr);
```

The `test` method here would return `true`.

##  instructions 

Fix the regex so that it checks for the names of `Franklin Roosevelt` or `Eleanor Roosevelt` in a case sensitive manner and it should make concessions for middle names.

Then fix the code so that the regex that you have created is checked against `myString` and either `true` or `false` is returned depending on whether the regex matches.
