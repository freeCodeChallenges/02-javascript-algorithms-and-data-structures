## Description
------

[Home - Regular Expressions](../regular-expressions/README.md)

[Before](./02-match-literal-strings.md)  | [Next](./04-ignore-case-while-matching.md) 

Using regexes like `/coding/`, you can look for the pattern `coding` in another string.

This is powerful to search single strings, but it's limited to only one pattern. You can search for multiple patterns using the `alternation` or `OR` operator: `|`.

This operator matches patterns either before or after it. For example, if you wanted to match the strings `yes` or `no`, the regex you want is `/yes|no/`.

You can also search for more than just two patterns. You can do this by adding more patterns with more `OR` operators separating them, like `/yes|no|maybe/`.

## instructions 

Complete the regex `petRegex` to match the pets `dog`, `cat`, `bird`, or `fish`.
