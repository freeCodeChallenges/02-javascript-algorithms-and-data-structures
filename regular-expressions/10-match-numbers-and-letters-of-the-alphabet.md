[Home - Regular Expressions](../regular-expressions/README.md)

[Before](./09-match-letters-of-the-alphabet.md)  | [Next](./11-match-single-characters-not-specified.md) 

Using the hyphen (`-`) to match a range of characters is not limited to letters. It also works to match a range of numbers.

For example, `/[0-5]/` matches any number between `0` and `5`, including the `0` and `5`.

Also, it is possible to combine a range of letters and numbers in a single character set.

```js
let jennyStr = "Jenny8675309";
let myRegex = /[a-z0-9]/ig;
jennyStr.match(myRegex);
```

##  instructions 

Create a single regex that matches a range of letters between `h` and `s`, and a range of numbers between `2` and `6`. Remember to include the appropriate flags in the regex.
