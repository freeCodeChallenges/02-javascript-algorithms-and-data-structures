## Description
------

[Home - Regular Expressions](../regular-expressions/README.md)

[Before](./16-match-beginning-string-patterns.md)  | [Next](./18-match-all-letters-and-numbers.md) 

In the last challenge, you learned to use the caret character to search for patterns at the beginning of strings. There is also a way to search for patterns at the end of strings.

You can search the end of strings using the dollar sign character `$` at the end of the regex.

```js
let theEnding = "This is a never ending story";
let storyRegex = /story$/;
storyRegex.test(theEnding);
let noEnding = "Sometimes a story will have to end";
storyRegex.test(noEnding);
```

The first `test` call would return `true`, while the second would return `false`.

##  instructions 

Use the anchor character (`$`) to match the string `caboose` at the end of the string `caboose`.
