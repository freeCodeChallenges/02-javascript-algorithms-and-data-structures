Sometimes you won't (or don't need to) know the exact characters in your patterns. Thinking of all words that match, say, a misspelling would take a long time. Luckily, you can save time using the wildcard character: `.`

The wildcard character `.` will match any one character. The wildcard is also called `dot` and `period`. You can use the wildcard character just like any other character in the regex. For example, if you wanted to match `hug`, `huh`, `hut`, and `hum`, you can use the regex `/hu./` to match all four words.

```js
let humStr = "I'll hum a song";
let hugStr = "Bear hug";
let huRegex = /hu./;
huRegex.test(humStr);
huRegex.test(hugStr);
```

Both of these `test` calls would return `true`.

##  instructions 

Complete the regex `unRegex` so that it matches the strings `run`, `sun`, `fun`, `pun`, `nun`, and `bun`. Your regex should use the wildcard character.
