[Home - Regular Expressions](../regular-expressions/README.md)

[Before](./07-match-anything-with-wildcard-period.md)  | [Next](./09-match-letters-of-the-alphabet.md) 

You learned how to match literal patterns (`/literal/`) and wildcard character (`/./`). Those are the extremes of regular expressions, where one finds exact matches and the other matches everything. There are options that are a balance between the two extremes.

You can search for a literal pattern with some flexibility with <dfn>character classes</dfn>. Character classes allow you to define a group of characters you wish to match by placing them inside square (`[` and `]`) brackets.

For example, you want to match `bag`, `big`, and `bug` but not `bog`. You can create the regex `/b[aiu]g/` to do this. The `[aiu]` is the character class that will only match the characters `a`, `i`, or `u`.

```js
let bigStr = "big";
let bagStr = "bag";
let bugStr = "bug";
let bogStr = "bog";
let bgRegex = /b[aiu]g/;
bigStr.match(bgRegex);
bagStr.match(bgRegex);
bugStr.match(bgRegex);
bogStr.match(bgRegex);
```

In order, the four `match` calls would return the values `["big"]`, `["bag"]`, `["bug"]`, and `null`.

##  instructions 

Use a character class with vowels (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`) in your regex `vowelRegex` to find all the vowels in the string `quoteSample`.

**Note:** Be sure to match both upper- and lowercase vowels.
