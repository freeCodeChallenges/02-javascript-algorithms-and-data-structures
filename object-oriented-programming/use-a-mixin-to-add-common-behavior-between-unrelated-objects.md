## Description

[Object Oriented Programming](../object-oriented-programming/README.md)

[Before](./override-inherited-methods.md)  | [Next](./use-closure-to-protect-properties-within-an-object-from-being-modified-externally.md) 

As you have seen, behavior is shared through inheritance. However, there are cases when inheritance is not the best solution. Inheritance does not work well for unrelated objects like `Bird` and `Airplane`. They can both fly, but a `Bird` is not a type of `Airplane` and vice versa.

For unrelated objects, it's better to use <dfn>mixins</dfn>. A mixin allows other objects to use a collection of functions.

```js
let flyMixin = function(obj) {
  obj.fly = function() {
    console.log("Flying, wooosh!");
  }
};
```

The `flyMixin` takes any object and gives it the `fly` method.

```js
let bird = {
  name: "Donald",
  numLegs: 2
};

let plane = {
  model: "777",
  numPassengers: 524
};

flyMixin(bird);
flyMixin(plane);
```

Here `bird` and `plane` are passed into `flyMixin`, which then assigns the `fly` function to each object. Now `bird` and `plane` can both fly:

```js
bird.fly();
plane.fly();
```

The console would display the string `Flying, wooosh!` twice, once for each `.fly()` call.

Note how the mixin allows for the same `fly` method to be reused by unrelated objects `bird` and `plane`.

##  instructions 

Create a mixin named `glideMixin` that defines a method named `glide`. Then use the `glideMixin` to give both `bird` and `boat` the ability to glide.
