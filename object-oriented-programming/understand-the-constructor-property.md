## Description
------

[Object Oriented Programming](../object-oriented-programming/README.md)

[Before](./iterate-over-all-properties.md)  | [Next](./change-the-prototype-to-a-new-object.md) 

There is a special `constructor` property located on the object instances `duck` and `beagle` that were created in the previous challenges:

```js
let duck = new Bird();
let beagle = new Dog();

console.log(duck.constructor === Bird); 
console.log(beagle.constructor === Dog);
```

Both of these `console.log` calls would display `true` in the console.

Note that the `constructor` property is a reference to the constructor function that created the instance. The advantage of the `constructor` property is that it's possible to check for this property to find out what kind of object it is. Here's an example of how this could be used:

```js
function joinBirdFraternity(candidate) {
  if (candidate.constructor === Bird) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```

**Note:** Since the `constructor` property can be overwritten (which will be covered in the next two challenges) itâ€™s generally better to use the `instanceof` method to check the type of an object.

##  instructions 

Write a `joinDogFraternity` function that takes a `candidate` parameter and, using the `constructor` property, return `true` if the candidate is a `Dog`, otherwise return `false`.
