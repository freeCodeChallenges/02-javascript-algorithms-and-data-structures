## Description
------

[Object Oriented Programming](../object-oriented-programming/README.md)

[Before](./inherit-behaviors-from-a-supertype.md)  | [Next](./reset-an-inherited-constructor-property.md) 

In the previous challenge you saw the first step for inheriting behavior from the supertype (or parent) `Animal`: making a new instance of `Animal`.

This challenge covers the next step: set the `prototype` of the subtype (or child)—in this case, `Bird`—to be an instance of `Animal`.

```js
Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
```

Remember that the `prototype` is like the "recipe" for creating an object. In a way, the recipe for `Bird` now includes all the key "ingredients" from `Animal`.

```js
let duck = new Bird("Donald");
duck.eat();
```

`duck` inherits all of `Animal`'s properties, including the `eat` method.

##  instructions 

Modify the code so that instances of `Dog` inherit from `Animal`.
