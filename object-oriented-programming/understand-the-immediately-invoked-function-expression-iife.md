## Description

[Object Oriented Programming](../object-oriented-programming/README.md)

[Before](./use-closure-to-protect-properties-within-an-object-from-being-modified-externally.md)  | [Next](./use-an-iife-to-create-a-module.md) 

A common pattern in JavaScript is to execute a function as soon as it is declared:

```js
(function () {
  console.log("Chirp, chirp!");
})();
```

This is an anonymous function expression that executes right away, and outputs `Chirp, chirp!` immediately.

Note that the function has no name and is not stored in a variable. The two parentheses () at the end of the function expression cause it to be immediately executed or invoked. This pattern is known as an <dfn>immediately invoked function expression</dfn> or <dfn>IIFE</dfn>.

##  instructions 

Rewrite the function `makeNest` and remove its call so instead it's an anonymous immediately invoked function expression (IIFE).
