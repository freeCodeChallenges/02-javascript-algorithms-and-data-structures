## Description

[Object Oriented Programming](../object-oriented-programming/README.md)

[Before](./extend-constructors-to-receive-arguments.md)  | [Next](./understand-own-properties.md) 

Anytime a constructor function creates a new object, that object is said to be an <dfn>instance</dfn> of its constructor. JavaScript gives a convenient way to verify this with the `instanceof` operator. `instanceof` allows you to compare an object to a constructor, returning `true` or `false` based on whether or not that object was created with the constructor. Here's an example:

```js
let Bird = function(name, color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let crow = new Bird("Alexis", "black");

crow instanceof Bird;
```

This `instanceof` method would return `true`.

If an object is created without using a constructor, `instanceof` will verify that it is not an instance of that constructor:

```js
let canary = {
  name: "Mildred",
  color: "Yellow",
  numLegs: 2
};

canary instanceof Bird;
```

This `instanceof` method would return `false`.

##  instructions 

Create a new instance of the `House` constructor, calling it `myHouse` and passing a number of bedrooms. Then, use `instanceof` to verify that it is an instance of `House`.
