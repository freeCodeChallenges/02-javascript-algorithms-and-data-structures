## Description
------

[Object Oriented Programming](../object-oriented-programming/README.md)

[Before](./reset-an-inherited-constructor-property.md)  | [Next](./override-inherited-methods.md) 

A constructor function that inherits its `prototype` object from a supertype constructor function can still have its own methods in addition to inherited methods.

For example, `Bird` is a constructor that inherits its `prototype` from `Animal`:

```js
function Animal() { }
Animal.prototype.eat = function() {
  console.log("nom nom nom");
};
function Bird() { }
Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Bird.prototype.constructor = Bird;
```

In addition to what is inherited from `Animal`, you want to add behavior that is unique to `Bird` objects. Here, `Bird` will get a `fly()` function. Functions are added to `Bird's` `prototype` the same way as any constructor function:

```js
Bird.prototype.fly = function() {
  console.log("I'm flying!");
};
```

Now instances of `Bird` will have both `eat()` and `fly()` methods:

```js
let duck = new Bird();
duck.eat();
duck.fly();
```

`duck.eat()` would display the string `nom nom nom` in the console, and `duck.fly()` would display the string `I'm flying!`.

##  instructions 

Add all necessary code so the `Dog` object inherits from `Animal` and the `Dog`'s `prototype` constructor is set to `Dog`. Then add a `bark()` method to the `Dog` object so that `beagle` can both `eat()` and `bark()`. The `bark()` method should print `Woof!` to the console.
