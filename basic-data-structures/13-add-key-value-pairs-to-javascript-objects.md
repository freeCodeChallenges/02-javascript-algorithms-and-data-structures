At their most basic, objects are just collections of <dfn>key-value</dfn> pairs. In other words, they are pieces of data (<dfn>values</dfn>) mapped to unique identifiers called <dfn>properties</dfn> (<dfn>keys</dfn>). Take a look at an example:

```js
const tekkenCharacter = {
  player: 'Hwoarang',
  fightingStyle: 'Tae Kwon Doe',
  human: true
};
```

The above code defines a Tekken video game character object called `tekkenCharacter`. It has three properties, each of which map to a specific value. If you want to add an additional property, such as "origin", it can be done by assigning `origin` to the object:

```js
tekkenCharacter.origin = 'South Korea';
```

This uses dot notation. If you were to observe the `tekkenCharacter` object, it will now include the `origin` property. Hwoarang also had distinct orange hair. You can add this property with bracket notation by doing:

```js
tekkenCharacter['hair color'] = 'dyed orange';
```

Bracket notation is required if your property has a space in it or if you want to use a variable to name the property. In the above case, the property is enclosed in quotes to denote it as a string and will be added exactly as shown. Without quotes, it will be evaluated as a variable and the name of the property will be whatever value the variable is. Here's an example with a variable:

```js
const eyes = 'eye color';

tekkenCharacter[eyes] = 'brown';
```

After adding all the examples, the object will look like this:

```js
{
  player: 'Hwoarang',
  fightingStyle: 'Tae Kwon Doe',
  human: true,
  origin: 'South Korea',
  'hair color': 'dyed orange',
  'eye color': 'brown'
};
```

##  instructions 

A `foods` object has been created with three entries. Using the syntax of your choice, add three more entries to it: `bananas` with a value of `13`, `grapes` with a value of `35`, and `strawberries` with a value of `27`.
