One of the simplest and most widely known <dfn>ciphers</dfn> is a <dfn>Caesar cipher</dfn>, also known as a <dfn>shift cipher</dfn>. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus `A ↔ N`, `B ↔ O` and so on.

Write a function which takes a [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.
