Return `true` if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return `false`.

A <dfn>palindrome</dfn> is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

**Note:** You'll need to remove **all non-alphanumeric characters** (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.

We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as `racecar`, `RaceCar`, and `race CAR` among others.

We'll also pass strings with special symbols, such as `2A3*3a2`, `2A3 3a2`, and `2_A3*3#A2`.
