<dfn>Concatenation</dfn> means to join items end to end. JavaScript offers the `concat` method for both strings and arrays that work in the same way. For arrays, the method is called on one, then another array is provided as the argument to `concat`, which is added to the end of the first array. It returns a new array and does not mutate either of the original arrays. Here's an example:

```js
[1, 2, 3].concat([4, 5, 6]);
```

The returned array would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

##  instructions 

Use the `concat` method in the `nonMutatingConcat` function to concatenate `attach` to the end of `original`. The function should return the concatenated array.
