## Description

[Before](./use-typeof-to-check-the-type-of-a-variable.md)  | [Next](./catch-unclosed-parentheses-brackets-braces-and-quotes.md)

The `console.log()` and `typeof` methods are the two primary ways to check intermediate values and types of program output. Now it's time to get into the common forms that bugs take. One syntax-level issue that fast typers can commiserate with is the humble spelling error.

Transposed, missing, or mis-capitalized characters in a variable or function name will have the browser looking for an object that doesn't exist - and complain in the form of a reference error. JavaScript variable and function names are case-sensitive.

##  instructions 

Fix the two spelling errors in the code so the `netWorkingCapital` calculation works.
