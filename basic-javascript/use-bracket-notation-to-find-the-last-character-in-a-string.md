## Description
------

[Basic JavaScript](../basic-javascript/README.html) 

[Before](./use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-nth-character-in-a-string.md)  | [Next](./use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-nth-to-last-character-in-a-string.md) 

In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.

For example, if `const firstName = "Ada"`, you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using `firstName[firstName.length - 1]`.

Example:

```js
const firstName = "Ada";
const lastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 1];
```

`lastLetter` would have a value of the string `a`.

##  instructions 

Use <dfn>bracket notation</dfn> to find the last character in the `lastName` variable.

**Hint:** Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.
