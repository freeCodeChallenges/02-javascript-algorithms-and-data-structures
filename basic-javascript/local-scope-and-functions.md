## Description
------

[Basic JavaScript](../basic-javascript/README.html) 

[Before](./global-scope-and-functions.md)  | [Next](./global-vs.-local-scope-in-functions.md) 

Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters, have <dfn>local</dfn> scope. That means they are only visible within that function.

Here is a function `myTest` with a local variable called `loc`.

```js
function myTest() {
  const loc = "foo";
  console.log(loc);
}

myTest();
console.log(loc);
```

The `myTest()` function call will display the string `foo` in the console. The `console.log(loc)` line (outside of the `myTest` function) will throw an error, as `loc` is not defined outside of the function.

##  instructions 

The editor has two `console.log`s to help you see what is happening. Check the console as you code to see how it changes. Declare a local variable `myVar` inside `myLocalScope` and run the tests.

**Note:** The console will still display `ReferenceError: myVar is not defined`, but this will not cause the tests to fail.
