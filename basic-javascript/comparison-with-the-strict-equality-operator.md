## Description
------

[Basic JavaScript](../basic-javascript/README.html) 

[Before](./comparison-with-the-equality-operator.md)  | [Next](./practice-comparing-different-values.md) 

Strict equality (`===`) is the counterpart to the equality operator (`==`). However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.

If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal, and the strict equality operator will return false.

**Examples**

```js
3 ===  3  // true
3 === '3' // false
```

In the second example, `3` is a `Number` type and `'3'` is a `String` type.

##  instructions 

Use the strict equality operator in the `if` statement so the function will return the string `Equal` when `val` is strictly equal to `7`.
