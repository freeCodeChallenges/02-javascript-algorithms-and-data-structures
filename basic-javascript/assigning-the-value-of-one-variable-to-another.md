## Description
------

[Basic JavaScript](../basic-javascript/README.html) 

[Before](./storing-values-with-the-assignment-operator.md)  | [Next](./initializing-variables-with-the-assignment-operator.md) 

After a value is assigned to a variable using the <dfn>assignment</dfn> operator, you can assign the value of that variable to another variable using the <dfn>assignment</dfn> operator.

```js
var myVar;
myVar = 5;
var myNum;
myNum = myVar;
```

The above declares a `myVar` variable with no value, then assigns it the value `5`. Next, a variable named `myNum` is declared with no value. Then, the contents of `myVar` (which is `5`) is assigned to the variable `myNum`. Now, `myNum` also has the value of `5`.

##  instructions 

Assign the contents of `a` to variable `b`.
