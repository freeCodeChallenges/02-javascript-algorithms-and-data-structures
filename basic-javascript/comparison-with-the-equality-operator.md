## Description
------

[Basic JavaScript](../basic-javascript/README.html) 

[Before](./use-conditional-logic-with-if-statements.md)  | [Next](./comparison-with-the-strict-equality-operator.md) 

There are many <dfn>comparison operators</dfn> in JavaScript. All of these operators return a boolean `true` or `false` value.

The most basic operator is the equality operator `==`. The equality operator compares two values and returns `true` if they're equivalent or `false` if they are not. Note that equality is different from assignment (`=`), which assigns the value on the right of the operator to a variable on the left.

```js
function equalityTest(myVal) {
  if (myVal == 10) {
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}
```

If `myVal` is equal to `10`, the equality operator returns `true`, so the code in the curly braces will execute, and the function will return `Equal`. Otherwise, the function will return `Not Equal`. In order for JavaScript to compare two different <dfn>data types</dfn> (for example, `numbers` and `strings`), it must convert one type to another. This is known as Type Coercion. Once it does, however, it can compare terms as follows:

```js
1   ==  1  // true
1   ==  2  // false
1   == '1' // true
"3" ==  3  // true
```

##  instructions 

Add the equality operator to the indicated line so that the function will return the string `Equal` when `val` is equivalent to `12`.
