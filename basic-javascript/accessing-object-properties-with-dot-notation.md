## Description
------

[Basic JavaScript](../basic-javascript/README.html) 

[Before](./build-javascript-objects.md)  | [Next](./accessing-object-properties-with-bracket-notation.md) 

There are two ways to access the properties of an object: dot notation (`.`) and bracket notation (`[]`), similar to an array.

Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

Here is a sample of using dot notation (`.`) to read an object's property:

```js
const myObj = {
  prop1: "val1",
  prop2: "val2"
};

const prop1val = myObj.prop1;
const prop2val = myObj.prop2;
```

`prop1val` would have a value of the string `val1`, and `prop2val` would have a value of the string `val2`.

##  instructions 

Read in the property values of `testObj` using dot notation. Set the variable `hatValue` equal to the object's property `hat` and set the variable `shirtValue` equal to the object's property `shirt`.
