## Description
------

[Basic JavaScript](../basic-javascript/README.html) 

[Before](./declare-javascript-variables.md)  | [Next](./assigning-the-value-of-one-variable-to-another.md) 

In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the <dfn>assignment</dfn> operator (`=`).

```js
myVariable = 5;
```

This assigns the `Number` value `5` to `myVariable`.

If there are any calculations to the right of the `=` operator, those are performed before the value is assigned to the variable on the left of the operator.

```js
var myVar;
myVar = 5;
```

First, this code creates a variable named `myVar`. Then, the code assigns `5` to `myVar`. Now, if `myVar` appears again in the code, the program will treat it as if it is `5`.

##  instructions 

Assign the value `7` to variable `a`.
