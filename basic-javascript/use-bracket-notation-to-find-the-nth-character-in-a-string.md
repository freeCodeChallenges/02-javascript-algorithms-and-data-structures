## Description
------

[Basic JavaScript](../basic-javascript/README.html) 

[Before](./understand-string-immutability.md)  | [Next](./use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-last-character-in-a-string.md) 

You can also use <dfn>bracket notation</dfn> to get the character at other positions within a string.

Remember that computers start counting at `0`, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

Example:

```js
const firstName = "Ada";
const secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];
```

`secondLetterOfFirstName` would have a value of the string `d`.

##  instructions 

Let's try to set `thirdLetterOfLastName` to equal the third letter of the `lastName` variable using bracket notation.

**Hint:** Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.
