[Basic JavaScript](../basic-javascript/README.html) 

[Before](./return-early-pattern-for-functions.md)  | [Next](./build-javascript-objects.md) 

In the casino game Blackjack, a player can gain an advantage over the house by keeping track of the relative number of high and low cards remaining in the deck. This is called [Card Counting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_counting).

Having more high cards remaining in the deck favors the player. Each card is assigned a value according to the table below. When the count is positive, the player should bet high. When the count is zero or negative, the player should bet low.

<table class='table table-striped'><thead><tr><th>Count Change</th><th>Cards</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>+1</td><td>2, 3, 4, 5, 6</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>7, 8, 9</td></tr><tr><td>-1</td><td>10, 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'</td></tr></tbody></table>

You will write a card counting function. It will receive a `card` parameter, which can be a number or a string, and increment or decrement the global `count` variable according to the card's value (see table). The function will then return a string with the current count and the string `Bet` if the count is positive, or `Hold` if the count is zero or negative. The current count and the player's decision (`Bet` or `Hold`) should be separated by a single space.

**Example Outputs:** `-3 Hold` or `5 Bet`

**Hint**  
Do NOT reset `count` to 0 when value is 7, 8, or 9.  
Do NOT return an array.  
Do NOT include quotes (single or double) in the output.
