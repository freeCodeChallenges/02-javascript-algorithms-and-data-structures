## Description
------

[Basic JavaScript](../basic-javascript/README.html) 

[Before](./find-the-length-of-a-string.md)  | [Next](./understand-string-immutability.md) 

<dfn>Bracket notation</dfn> is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0. This is referred to as <dfn>Zero-based</dfn> indexing.

For example, the character at index 0 in the word `Charles` is `C`. So if `const firstName = "Charles"`, you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using `firstName[0]`.

Example:

```js
const firstName = "Charles";
const firstLetter = firstName[0];
```

`firstLetter` would have a value of the string `C`.

##  instructions 

Use bracket notation to find the first character in the `lastName` variable and assign it to `firstLetterOfLastName`.

**Hint:** Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.
