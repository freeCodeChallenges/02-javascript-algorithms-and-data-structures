## Description
------

[Basic JavaScript](../basic-javascript/README.html) 

[Before](./understanding-uninitialized-variables.md)  | [Next](./explore-differences-between-the-var-and-let-keywords.md) 

In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.

`MYVAR` is not the same as `MyVar` nor `myvar`. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you *do not* use this language feature.

**Best Practice**

Write variable names in JavaScript in <dfn>camelCase</dfn>. In <dfn>camelCase</dfn>, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

**Examples:**

```js
var someVariable;
var anotherVariableName;
var thisVariableNameIsSoLong;
```

##  instructions 

Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use <dfn>camelCase</dfn>.

Do not create any new variables.
