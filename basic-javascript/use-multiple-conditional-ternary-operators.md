## Description
------

[Basic JavaScript](../basic-javascript/README.html) 

[Before](./use-the-conditional-ternary-operator.md)  | [Next](./use-recursion-to-create-a-countdown.md) 

In the previous challenge, you used a single conditional operator. You can also chain them together to check for multiple conditions.

The following function uses `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to check multiple conditions:

```js
function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  if (a === b) {
    return "a and b are equal";
  }
  else if (a > b) {
    return "a is greater";
  }
  else {
    return "b is greater";
  }
}
```

The above function can be re-written using multiple conditional operators:

```js
function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  return (a === b) ? "a and b are equal" 
    : (a > b) ? "a is greater" 
    : "b is greater";
}
```

It is considered best practice to format multiple conditional operators such that each condition is on a separate line, as shown above. Using multiple conditional operators without proper indentation may make your code hard to read. For example:

```js
function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  return (a === b) ? "a and b are equal" : (a > b) ? "a is greater" : "b is greater";
}
```

##  instructions 

In the `checkSign` function, use multiple conditional operators - following the recommended format used in `findGreaterOrEqual` - to check if a number is positive, negative or zero. The function should return `positive`, `negative` or `zero`.
