## Description
------

[Basic JavaScript](../basic-javascript/README.html) 

[Before](./divide-one-decimal-by-another-with-javascript.md)  | [Next](./compound-assignment-with-augmented-addition.md) 

The <dfn>remainder</dfn> operator `%` gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

**Example**

<blockquote>5 % 2 = 1 because<br>Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)<br>2 * 2 = 4<br>5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)</blockquote>

**Usage**  
In mathematics, a number can be checked to be even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by `2`.

<blockquote>17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)<br>48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)</blockquote>

**Note:** The <dfn>remainder</dfn> operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the modulus operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.

##  instructions 

Set `remainder` equal to the remainder of `11` divided by `3` using the <dfn>remainder</dfn> (`%`) operator.
