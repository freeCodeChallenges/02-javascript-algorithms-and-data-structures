[Basic JavaScript](../basic-javascript/README.html) 

[Before](./testing-objects-for-properties.md)  | [Next](./accessing-nested-arrays.md) 

Sometimes you may want to store data in a flexible <dfn>Data Structure</dfn>. A JavaScript object is one way to handle flexible data. They allow for arbitrary combinations of <dfn>strings</dfn>, <dfn>numbers</dfn>, <dfn>booleans</dfn>, <dfn>arrays</dfn>, <dfn>functions</dfn>, and <dfn>objects</dfn>.

Here's an example of a complex data structure:

```js
const ourMusic = [
  {
    "artist": "Daft Punk",
    "title": "Homework",
    "release_year": 1997,
    "formats": [ 
      "CD", 
      "Cassette", 
      "LP"
    ],
    "gold": true
  }
];
```

This is an array which contains one object inside. The object has various pieces of <dfn>metadata</dfn> about an album. It also has a nested `formats` array. If you want to add more album records, you can do this by adding records to the top level array. Objects hold data in a property, which has a key-value format. In the example above, `"artist": "Daft Punk"` is a property that has a key of `artist` and a value of `Daft Punk`. [JavaScript Object Notation](http://www.json.org/) or `JSON` is a related data interchange format used to store data.

```json
{
  "artist": "Daft Punk",
  "title": "Homework",
  "release_year": 1997,
  "formats": [ 
    "CD",
    "Cassette",
    "LP"
  ],
  "gold": true
}
```

**Note:** You will need to place a comma after every object in the array, unless it is the last object in the array.

##  instructions 

Add a new album to the `myMusic` array. Add `artist` and `title` strings, `release_year` number, and a `formats` array of strings.
