## Description

[Home - ES6](../es6/README.md)

[Before](./02-mutate-an-array-declared-with-const.md)  | [Next](./04-use-arrow-functions-to-write-concise-anonymous-functions.md)

As seen in the previous challenge, `const` declaration alone doesn't really protect your data from mutation. To ensure your data doesn't change, JavaScript provides a function `Object.freeze` to prevent data mutation.

Any attempt at changing the object will be rejected, with an error thrown if the script is running in strict mode.

```js
let obj = {
  name:"FreeCodeCamp",
  review:"Awesome"
};
Object.freeze(obj);
obj.review = "bad";
obj.newProp = "Test";
console.log(obj); 
```

The `obj.review` and `obj.newProp` assignments will result in errors, because our editor runs in strict mode by default, and the console will display the value `{ name: "FreeCodeCamp", review: "Awesome" }`.

##  instructions 

In this challenge you are going to use `Object.freeze` to prevent mathematical constants from changing. You need to freeze the `MATH_CONSTANTS` object so that no one is able to alter the value of `PI`, add, or delete properties.
