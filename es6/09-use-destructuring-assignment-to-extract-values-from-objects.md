<dfn>Destructuring assignment</dfn> is special syntax introduced in ES6, for neatly assigning values taken directly from an object.

Consider the following ES5 code:

```js
const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };

const name = user.name;
const age = user.age;
```

`name` would have a value of the string `John Doe`, and `age` would have the number `34`.

Here's an equivalent assignment statement using the ES6 destructuring syntax:

```js
const { name, age } = user;
```

Again, `name` would have a value of the string `John Doe`, and `age` would have the number `34`.

Here, the `name` and `age` variables will be created and assigned the values of their respective values from the `user` object. You can see how much cleaner this is.

You can extract as many or few values from the object as you want.

##  instructions 

Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment. It should still assign the variables `today` and `tomorrow` the values of `today` and `tomorrow` from the `HIGH_TEMPERATURES` object.
